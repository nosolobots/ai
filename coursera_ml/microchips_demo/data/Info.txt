Microchip Demo
==============

Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the
test results for some microchips on two different tests. From these two tests,
you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or
rejected. To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results
on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.

Your task is to implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether 
microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assur-ance (QA).
